# Minesweeper
In the first term of my university studies, I developed the Game Minesweeper as a project. 
This undertaking was a remarkable achievement, as it involved the application of various technical skills and the implementation of complex algorithms.
The process of designing and implementing this game was both challenging and rewarding, as it required careful planning and attention to detail.
Overall, the successful creation of Minesweeper demonstrated my proficiency in programming and my ability to undertake substantial projects in a 
university setting.
